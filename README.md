## Community Edition (CE)

The goal of this project is to revive and continue development and maintenance of the abandoned Razor project, focusing on "quality of life" improvements while attempting to keep the spirit and vision the original developers had for Razor and not driving down the path of advanced automation and scripting that's found in other UO assistants.

It's recommended that you use the [ClassicUO](https://github.com/ClassicUO/ClassicUO) client with this version of Razor, however it should will work with the original 5.x and 7.x clients though support for any bugs may be limited.
